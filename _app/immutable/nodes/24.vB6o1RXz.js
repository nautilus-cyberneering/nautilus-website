			using Boken Engine. It could be used as a boilerplate for your own projects. We are planning
			to add more documentation about how to integrate Boken Engine on your own app but this sample
			should be useful to understand and play with all the Boken Engine features.</p> <p class="svelte-1eo47q2">If you want to use Boken Engine we think you should try first to setup and run Iakkai. You can
			also follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/boken-engine/boken-engine">Boken Engine documentation</a>.</p> <p class="svelte-1eo47q2">Regarding making it fun, we chose a game topic that some mantainers know very well. In fact,
